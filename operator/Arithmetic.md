# Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values such as integers and floats. They’re the building blocks of math in your code — just like +, -, ×, ÷ on a real calculator.
- Imagine you’re building a simple calculator app for your little cousin who just started learning math.
- The first thing you’ll need are basic operations — like adding her candies, subtracting the ones she eats, or splitting them equally between her and her friends.

## Python supports the following arithmetic operators:

1. Addition (+): Adds two values.
2. Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another.
3. Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
4. Division (/): Divides one value by another and returns a float.
5. Floor Division (//): Divides and returns the integer part of the result (discarding the decimal).
6. Modulus (%): Returns the remainder after division.
7. Exponentiation (**): Raises one number to the power of another.

These operators can be used with variables or direct numeric values, and Python handles type conversion automatically when needed.
