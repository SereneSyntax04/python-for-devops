# Assignment Operator 

> Think of a whiteboard where you're tracking your scores. Every time your score changes â€” whether it goes up, down, or multiplies â€” you're updating the same board, not creating a new one.
* In Python, assignment operators help you update variables easily and concisely.

##  List of Assignment Operators
score = 10          # Basic Assignment (=)
score += 5          # score = score + 5 â†’ 15
score -= 3          # score = score - 3 â†’ 12
score *= 2          # score = score * 2 â†’ 24
score /= 4          # score = score / 4 â†’ 6.0
score //= 2         # score = score // 2 â†’ 3.0 (Floor Division)
score %= 2          # score = score % 2 â†’ 1.0 (Remainder)
score **= 3         # score = score ** 3 â†’ 1.0 (Exponentiation)


## ðŸ“Œ Here's what each one does:
| Operator | Example   | Description                           |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | `x = 5`   | Assigns 5 to `x`.                     |
| `+=`     | `x += 2`  | Adds 2 to `x` (same as `x = x + 2`).  |
| `-=`     | `x -= 3`  | Subtracts 3 from `x`.                 |
| `*=`     | `x *= 4`  | Multiplies `x` by 4.                  |
| `/=`     | `x /= 2`  | Divides `x` by 2 (result is float).   |
| `//=`    | `x //= 2` | Floor divides `x` by 2.               |
| `%=`     | `x %= 2`  | Stores remainder of `x` divided by 2. |
| `**=`    | `x **= 3` | Raises `x` to the power of 3.         |
