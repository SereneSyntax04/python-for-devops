# Identity Operators

In Python, everything is an object stored somewhere in memory. Sometimes, you need to check not just if two variables have the same value, but whether they are actually the exact same object in memory.

That’s where identity operators come in. They help answer the question:

“Are these two variables pointing to the same thing in memory?”

##  List of Identity Operators
| Operator | Description                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `is`     | Returns `True` if **both operands refer to the same object** in memory.                |
| `is not` | Returns `True` if **operands refer to different objects**, even if they look the same. |
