# Membership Operators

Membership operators in Python let you check whether a value exists inside a sequence — like a list, tuple, string, or even a dictionary.

Think of it like asking:

> “Is this name on the guest list?”
> Or
> “Is this word in the sentence?”

These checks return a simple True or False.


## List of Membership Operators
| Operator | Description                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `in`     | Returns `True` if the left operand **exists** in the right-side sequence. |
| `not in` | Returns `True` if the left operand **does not exist** in the sequence.    |


## When to Use
- To check if an item is in a list, string, tuple, or set
- To filter or validate input
- To conditionally trigger logic (like access checks or search operations)
