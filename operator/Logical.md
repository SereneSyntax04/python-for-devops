# Logical Operators

In Python, logical operators are used to combine or invert Boolean values (True or False). Think of them as the decision-makers in your code — they help you write conditions like:

> “Should I go out if it’s not raining and I have money?”

That’s logic. Python gives you three main tools to do it: and, or, and not.


## List of Logical Operators
| Operator | Name        | Description                                             |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `and`    | Logical AND | Returns `True` only if **both** conditions are `True`.  |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | Returns `True` if **at least one** condition is `True`. |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | Reverses the Boolean value. `not True` becomes `False`. |


## When to Use
- Inside if conditions to check multiple criteria
- To combine smaller checks into a bigger decision
- To invert a condition when needed
