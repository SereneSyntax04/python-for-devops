# Relational Operators 

Relational operators are used to compare two values and find out how they relate — whether they’re equal, unequal, greater, or smaller.

These comparisons return a Boolean:
True ✅ or False ❌.

Think of it like:

> “Is Aryan older than Meera?”
> “Do they have the same number of chocolates?”


## List of Relational Operators
| Operator | Description                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to → Returns `True` if both values are the same |
| `!=`     | Not equal to → Returns `True` if values are different |
| `>`      | Greater than                                          |
| `<`      | Less than                                             |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to                              |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to                                 |


## Where You’ll Use These
- In if conditions to compare numbers, strings, etc.
- Sorting logic, eligibility checks, thresholds
- Anywhere you need a decision based on a comparison
