# Think of a dictionary like a real-life dictionary:
- You look up a word (the key)
- You get its meaning (the value)

##  What is a Dictionary?
- Key-value pairs: Each item has a key (unique) and a value.
- Keys can be strings, numbers, or tuples (immutable types).
- Values can be anything: numbers, strings, lists, even other dictionaries.
- Created using {} or the dict() constructor.

## Basic Syntax:
```python
my_dict = {
    "name": "Shrushti",
    "age": 21,
    "skills": ["Python", "AWS", "DevOps"]
}
```
Here:
- "name", "age", "skills" → keys
- "Shrushti", 21, ["Python", "AWS", "DevOps"] → values
