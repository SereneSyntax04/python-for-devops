# 🛠️ Shell Scripting vs Python in DevOps

Choosing between **Shell Scripting** and **Python** depends on the **task complexity** and **what you’re trying to automate**. 
---

## ✅ When to Use **Shell Scripting**

- **System-level tasks**
  - Start/stop services, manage users, file operations, permissions.
- **Command-line tool automation**
  - Efficient for combining `ls`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, etc.
- **Quick one-time tasks**
  - Lightweight and fast to write.
- **Log/text file parsing**
  - Perfect for scanning logs, replacing strings, or extracting data.
- **Environment configuration**
  - Export variables, modify `.bashrc`, set up system configs.

---

## ✅ When to Use **Python**

- **Complex logic or workflows**
  - When shell scripts become long or unreadable.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**
  - Works seamlessly across Linux, Windows, macOS.
- **APIs & web services**
  - Use libraries like `requests`, `boto3` for cloud/API tasks.
- **Reusable and maintainable code**
  - Functions, modules, and OOP support.
- **Data processing**
  - Ideal with `pandas`, `numpy`, `json`, etc.
- **Robust error handling**
  - Easier debugging and better exception management.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** In real-world DevOps, it's common to use both. Shell scripts for bootstrapping or simple system jobs, and Python for anything that needs logic, APIs, or cross-system support.
