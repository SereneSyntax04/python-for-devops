# Understanding Lists and List Data Structure in Python
ðŸ§¾ What is a List?
A list is a built-in data structure in Python used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are:
- Ordered â†’ items maintain the order in which they were added.
- Mutable â†’ you can modify them (add, remove, or change elements).
- Flexible â†’ can contain mixed data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc).

ðŸ§  Think of it as a shopping bag holding different items.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']
```

## Mini Use-Case
You could use a list to store:

1. Running services
2. IP addresses in a subnet
3. Log lines matching a pattern
4. Packages to be installed on a VM
```python
packages = ['nginx', 'docker', 'git']
if 'docker' in packages:
    print("Docker already installed.")
```
